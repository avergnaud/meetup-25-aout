The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.",OSSINDEX,"","","",MEDIUM,5.300000190734863,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L,HIGHEST,8,"","","","","","","",""

A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.  Sonatype's research suggests that this CVE's details differ from those defined at NVD.

If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself.  #### Prerequisites * Next.js (`<14.1.1`) is running in a self-hosted* manner. * The Next.js application makes use of Server Actions. * The Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`.  \* Many hosting providers (including Vercel) route requests based on the Host header, so we do not believe that this vulnerability affects any Next.js applications where routing is done in this manner.  ### Patches This vulnerability was patched in [#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561) and fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.   ### Workarounds There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to Next.js `14.1.1`.  ### Credit Vercel and the Next.js team thank Assetnote for responsibly disclosing this issue to us, and for working with us to verify the fix.
